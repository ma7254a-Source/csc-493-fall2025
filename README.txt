Welcome to Project ALCHEMY's Github Repository

Included in this repository is all of the necessary code and information to get ALCHEMY working on your system. Do be warned, this process is a little tedious. 
Most of the steps are configuring the virutal machines, setting up the network, some basic yaml code to set static IPs. Like I said: tedious stuff. 
In the Project ALCHEMY Setup Guide file, you can find a full set up guide to build ALCHEMY on your system.  Than you, enjoy!
