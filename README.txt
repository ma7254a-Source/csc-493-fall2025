Welcome to Project ALCHEMY's Github Repository

Included in this repository is all of the necessary code and information to get ALCHEMY working on your system. Do be warned, this process is a little tedious. 
Most of the steps are configuring the virtual machines, setting up the network, and some basic yaml code to set static IPs. Like I said: tedious stuff. 
In the Project ALCHEMY Setup Guide file, you can find a full set up guide to build ALCHEMY on your system.  You can also find our Rules of Engagement, a document detailing how we're allowed to conduct cyber attacks.
It's really more of a formality since we are on a host-only network, but it also represents a type of methodology/design relevant to the project. 


Thank you, enjoy!
